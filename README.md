# Intermediate-Stock-Trading-News-Alert-Project-discription
Here is a general description of the project:

Fetching Stock Data: The program will use an API (such as Alpha Vantage) to fetch the latest stock market data for the specified companies. This data may include stock prices, price changes, and other relevant information.

Fetching News Data: The program will use an API (such as NewsAPI) to retrieve news articles related to the specified companies. The articles may contain information that could potentially impact the stock market, such as company announcements, industry updates, or economic news.

Analyzing Stock Data: The program will analyze the fetched stock data to identify the percentage change in stock prices for the specified companies. It will compare this change against the user-defined threshold.

Filtering News Articles: The program will filter the fetched news articles based on keywords or specific criteria related to the specified companies. This helps ensure that only relevant news articles are considered for triggering email alerts.

Sending Email Alerts: When the program identifies a stock whose price has crossed the user-defined threshold and finds relevant news articles, it will compose an email alert. The email will include details about the stock, such as the company name, stock symbol, price change, and a link to the relevant news article.

Automation and Scheduling: The program can be set to run periodically or at specific intervals using a task scheduling tool or a built-in feature within the program. This allows for regular monitoring of the stock market and the generation of timely email alerts.
